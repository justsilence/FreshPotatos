# Front-End Technology Description

In this section, we will describe all technologies we had used in our project.

## A brief view of technologies

- ReactJS & NodeJS

We picked ReactJS as our front-end framework, all the front-end codes are based on this framework.

- MaterialUI

We picked MaterialUI as our style framework, it's similar with Bootstrap, but its style is Google material style which makes it differs to other common Bootstrap websites.

- Others

Other technologies like Babel, webpack and JSX are integrated in React-scripts which is powered by npm for easier developing a ReactJS project.

## Implementation detail

This section we will describe how each component is created and how to integrate them into a completed functional website. Before movie to next step, we would like to introduce the basic architecture of our component's implementation: first of all we define the style class use MaterialUI, the style classes will be used as className=classes.style in different component. Second, we create a ReactJS component class, which stores necessary states and data
